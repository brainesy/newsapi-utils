(sic). \n\nAppearing to be nervous, Himon said that the crash outside the Rockefeller Center, in which 23-year-old Sian Green lost her foot, was caused when he accelerated away from cyclist Kenneth Olivo because he was afraid that he was going to be attacked. \n\nAlongside Himon was Fernando Mateo, the president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers. \n\nSpeaking on the same day that the Taxi and Limousine Commission suspended Himon's license for 30 days, Mateo said that the real culprit is Olivio, who has been arrested 22 times.

Plumber David Justino immediately applied a tourniquet made from a belt. \n\nJustino was praised by medics for his \"quick-thinking\" after tying his belt around Green's leg to act as a tourniquet, stemming the blood loss. \n\nJustino told The New York Times he was determined to hold on until help arrived, and then he saw Oz over his shoulder. \n\n\"I felt more comfortable when I looked up and saw his face,\" Justino said. \"I said, 'What should I do?' and he said, 'You're doing it. You're doing it.\"' \n\nDr Oz had been filming for a television show near the accident scene in midtown Manhattan about 11am local time. \n\nFood vendor Max Crespo put Green's severed leg on ice, following the directions of a nurse whose name he didn't know. \n\n\"I took water and grabbed this bucket with ice,\" Crespo told the Times. \"The nurse, she told me to pour water on her legs, and I did. And that is when she screamed a lot like I was pouring fire on her.\" \n\nDr Spiros Frangos, a senior trauma surgeon at Bellevue hospital, said Green was \"fortunate\" not to have suffered more serious injury. \n\nDoctors had to amputate her left foot and she has undergone treatment to wounds on her other leg as a result of the accident. \n\nDr Frangos, Bellevue's associate director of surgery and director of the surgical intensive care unit, said nothing could have been done to reattach her amputated limb despite the best efforts of medics. \n\n\"Ms Green had her left leg amputated below the knee as a result of the accident,\" he said. \n\n\"Given the condition of the lower leg, replantation was not an option. \n\n\"Her right leg sustained multiple deep lacerations which were also cleaned and repaired and will likely regain most functionality with time and physical therapy.\"",
